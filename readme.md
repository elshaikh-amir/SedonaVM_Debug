Sedona Debug Virtual Machine
================================================

For original source codes: https://sedona-alliance.org/archive/doc/index.html

**Aim:**
- Enable smart debugging for Sedona Applications. (Use eclipse or any IDE with a java-debugger to debug a sedona application)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Status: Incomplete.

I have been developing this debug-mode for a few months as a university project, but due to university i didn't find the time to sit down and fix this and to move to a functional prototype.

This is my first time i have used the programming language C. If you find better ways to model this code, feel free to make a request. I hope some interested coders will finish this.


Check jdwp folder, this contains an impl. for the JDWP protocol, matching the sedona language.

Enjoy!
